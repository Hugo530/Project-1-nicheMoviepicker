# Project-1-nicheMoviepicker
we created a website that gives users a random movie from the IMDB movie data base.
when you get to the landing page you will have three choices Horror,Comedy, or Drama.
after clicking on one of the buttons you will then be sent to a second page, from there
you will get four random movie's from what ever button you choose.
